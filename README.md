## üéØ Our Mission

Fuselock tackles critical security vulnerabilities in modern dependency-driven software ecosystems by providing runtime protection and granular access control. 
**Security should not be an afterthought and a reactive practice. **
Our tools provide developers with fine-grained control over their applications' runtime behavior, helping to prevent supply chain attacks and ensuring secure execution across different platforms.
We belive in a fully transparent open source driven security where vulnerabilities are prevented and discovered at rapid speed. Community driven innovation without vendor locking. 

## üåü Key focuc

- **Runtime Security Layer**: Intercept and restrict OS operations at runtime
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Solutions for JavaScript, Python, and cloud environments
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Detailed permission management for network, file system, and process operations
- **Supply Chain Security**: Built-in protection against malicious dependencies
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Every package must explicitly declare its requirements
- **Performance Focused**: Minimal overhead while maintaining robust security

## üèóÔ∏è Our Projects

### fuselockjs (Node.js)
A runtime security layer for Node.js applications that intercepts and restricts OS operations. [Learn more](https://github.com/fuselockhq/fuselockls)

### Coming Soon
- **fuselockpy**: Runtime security for Python applications
- **cloudlock**: Security management for cloud-native applications
- **containerlock**: Container-level security orchestration

## üîí Security Philosophy

Our package managers follow these core principles:

1. **Explicit Permissions**: All capabilities must be explicitly granted
2. **Least Privilege**: Packages only get the minimum permissions they need
3. **Inheritance Control**: Parent packages control their dependencies' permissions
4. **Runtime Verification**: Continuous monitoring and enforcement of security policies
5. **Transparent Operation**: Clear visibility into all security decisions

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Each of our tools follows a similar pattern for integration:

1. **Installation**: Available through standard package managers
2. **Configuration**: JSON-based security policies
3. **Integration**: Simple setup with minimal code changes
4. **Monitoring**: Built-in tools for security auditing

For specific installation instructions, please visit individual project repositories.
